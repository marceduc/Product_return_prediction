Name of Quantlet: prediction_regularized_logistic_regression

Published in: SPL

Description: 'Predicts the binary target variable product returns for a validation set by training a logistic regression model. Cross-validation and parameter tuning are conducted to obtain the optimal parameters and thus achieve the best prediction accuracy when later on fitting the trained classifier on the unlabeled test set'

Keywords: machine-learning, regularized-logistic-regression, lasso, ridge-regression, prediction, classification, cross-validation, parameter-tuning, accuracy-measure, AUC

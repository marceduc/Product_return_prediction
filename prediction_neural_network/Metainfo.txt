Published in: 'Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''How Can The Prediction Of Product Returns Reduce Costs In E-commerce?'' '

Description: 'Predicts the binary target variable product returns for a validation set by training a neural network. Cross-validation and parameter tuning are conducted to obtain the optimal parameters and thus achieve the best prediction accuracy when later on fitting the trained classifier on the unlabeled test set'

Keywords: machine-learning, neural-network, prediction, classification, cross-validation, parameter-tuning, accuracy-measure, AUC
